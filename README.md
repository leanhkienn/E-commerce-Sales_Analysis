## Database

The database is stored in SQL format and can be accessed using SQL Server or any compatible database management system. The CSV files provided for each table were imported into the database, ensuring that the data is structured and ready for analysis.

## Queries

Several SQL queries were performed on the database to extract meaningful insights and perform data analysis. The queries covered various aspects, such as calculating average shipping cost and price per product category, checking for duplicate values, and retrieving data for visualization purposes.
